#atvd_pi
a code that calcs PI by ramdomizing numbers a X times (choose by the user)
is calc if that ramdom number is in the circle (using radius to that), and then
multiplying 4 * (points in the circle/total points)

the accurancy of PI gets higher as the numbers of times that ramdom number
are generated
